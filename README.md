# Data Journey DAG

### Input: tab-delimited file containing adjacency matrix (rows=FROM, columns=TO) with headers (adjacency_matrix2.txt as a sample)
### Output: Graph of origin data and offspring data for the specified data element

After processes are created between data fields by genProcesses() command, the graph becomes a bipartite graph and it shows as follows.  Processes can be merged by coupleProcesses() as well.

### After the processes are generated by genProcesses(), the number of stages remain minimum (they were minimum without processes), and the paralell processing is maximum.  Also the number of processes become minimum while guranteeing minimum inter-process dependencies.  Further coupling of procsses will cause inter process dependencies, thus will cause bottleneck risk.  Further sequencing of processes will cause extra stages, and thus will cause longer throughputs.

  The data element inter-dependencies are business invariants, and cannot be altered while the resources and the process arrangements and efficiency themselves can be varied.  The DAG represents the ideal state of process arrangements that bears the least stages, the maximum parallelism and the least dependencies.  In reality, the resource allocation and the process arrangements/efficiency are constraints, and the actual implementation of process always elude away from the ideal state, so the generated graph can be utilized compare between the reality and the ideal.
  
Hilights:

- The graph is kept as a DAG.
- After the processes are added, the graph becomes a bipartite graph of elements and processes as well.
- compatible with adjacency matrix and edge list formats.
- The generated flow graphs show as topologically ordered.
- any node with the prefix "proc_" is regarded as a process, and everything else is regarded as an element by the tool.
