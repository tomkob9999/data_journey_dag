# Data Journey DAG

### Input: tab-delimited file containing adjacency matrix (rows=FROM, columns=TO) with headers (adjacency_matrix2.txt as a sample)
### Output: Graph of origin data and offspring data for the specified data element

After processes are created between data fields by genProcesses() command, the graph becomes a bipartite graph and it shows as follows.  Some processes are merged by coupleProcesses() as well.

### After the processes are generated by genProcesses(), the number of stages and the number of processes are guaranteed to be minimum in the assumption that maximum parallelism and bottleneck prevensions are realized.  Further coupling of procsses will cause extra dependencies and bottleneck risk.  Further sequencing of tasks will cause extra stages and longer throughputs.

Hilights:

- The graph is kept to be a DAG.
- After the processes are added, the graph becomes a bipartite graph of elements and processes as well.
- compatible with adjacency matrix and edge list formats.
- The generated flow graphs show as topologically ordered.
- any node with the prefix "proc_" is regarded as a process, and everything else is regarded as an element by the tool.
